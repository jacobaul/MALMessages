# MALMessages

The official and unofficial API's available for MyAnimeList.com do not provide endpoints for chat messages.

This project uses Selenium to provide a(n extremely clunky) automated scraper to retrieve (and send) messages on a MAL account.

Selenium is a very heavy way to scrape a web page. As such this project is suited only for low-volume uses such as backing up an account or two.
